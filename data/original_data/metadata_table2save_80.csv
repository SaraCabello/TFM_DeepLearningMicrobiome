Partial bacterial 16S rRNA genes from maize rhizosphere microbiota were amplified by using an Illumina primer pair. The Illumina primer pair contained a composite forward 515F primer with an Illumina-specific linker sequence, and a reverse 806R primer with unique 12-bp Golay indexes to multiplex the samples, and an Illumina-specific linker sequence. The PCR conditions were as described previously (Caporaso et al., 2011). Each DNA sample was amplified in triplets, and the triplets were pooled on the Eppendorf EpMotion automated pipetting system. The quality of amplification was checked using agarose gel electrophoreses. The pooled amplicons were purified with MagBind E-Z Pure beads, and were quantitated using Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA kits. The concentrations of samples were normalized, and the samples were mixed to make an equimolar library."
