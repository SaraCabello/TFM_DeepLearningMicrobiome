Repository to store data, models and scripts used and obtained during my master's final project 

## Folders' contents 🗂
#### Data 📉
This folder contains data used to train the models (original_data) and files obtained when this original data is transformed using the different models built along this work.

Transformed data folder is organised into sub-folders according to the models that produce each resulting file. 
  
#### Models 🧮
All the trained models obtained during the development of the project are available here, organised in different folders according to the different types of models of this work.
